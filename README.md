Mock TradeMe Website

This project is a **mock TradeMe clone** built as part of a mission-ready coding challenge.  
It includes two new features on top of a standard marketplace site:

- **Comparison List** – lets users select multiple listings and compare them side by side.
- **Bidding Tutorial** – a guided explanation of how the bidding system works.
